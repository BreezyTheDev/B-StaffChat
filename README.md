# Breezy Staff Chat

## What is it?

When you run the command `/sc <message>` it presents your message in the in-game chat for staff only. This script makes communicating with your fellow staff members 10 times easier and way more convenient. It also helps with muscle memory and lowers the chances of the intended message being leaked to the whole server. 

## Commands

`/sc <message>` - Requires `StaffChat.View` permission.
`/sc-toggle` - Requires `StaffChat.View` permission. (Toggles Staff Chat on or off)

## Example

`/sc How is the server doing?` - Basic example of how to utilize the command.

## Configuration

The following can be found in the ``server.lua`` file.
```
prefix = '^3[^1Staff Chat^3]'
```
You can configure the prefix to match your server name or leave it the way it is.
